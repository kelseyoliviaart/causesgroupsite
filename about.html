			<h1>Objectives</h1>
				Asha for Education  is a secular organization dedicated to change in India by focusing on basic education in the belief that education is a critical requisite for socio-economic change.
In keeping with this focus, our volunteers are involved with and support projects that are secular and have an education-related component to them. The objectives of this group are:
To provide education to underprivileged children in India.
To encourage the formation of various local groups across the world to reach out to larger sections of the population.
To support and cooperate with persons and groups already engaged in similar activities.
To raise the required human and other resources to achieve the group objectives.
To provide opportunities to individuals living outside India who wish to participate in Asha activities in India.
To address, whenever possible, other issues affecting human life such as health care, environment, socio-economic aspects and women's issues.

			<h1>Our Story</h1>
				In the summer of 1991, a few students including V.J.P.Srivatsavoy @ , D. Gupta # , and S. Pandey *  got together to think of ways in which they could play a role in the development of India, the country of their origin. These young people shared the belief that education is a critical requisite and an effective catalyst for social and economic change in India. Basic education became the agenda for the action group that emerged from this gathering. The group was named  Asha  to represent the  hope  that had brought these individuals together and the hope that they aimed to bring into the lives of children in India. In that summer of 1991, Asha was born at the University of California in Berkeley.
